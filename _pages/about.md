## Welcome

I'm Jeffrey Wei, a CS & Physics student at Yale University (May 2027). My research focuses on **AI4Physics**, **transfer learning**, and **Gaussian processes**. I'm passionate about applying machine learning techniques to physical systems and developing efficient learning methods for robotics and scientific applications.

## Research Interests

- **AI4Physics**: Using machine learning to accelerate physics simulations and solve complex physical problems
- **Transfer Learning**: Developing methods for robots to leverage diverse datasets and generalize across tasks
- **Gaussian Processes**: Exploring probabilistic models for uncertainty quantification in ML systems

## Interests & Hobbies

When I'm not working on research or coursework, you can find me:

- **Working out** and staying active
- **Exploring robotics** and building autonomous systems
- **Reading science fiction** novels
- **Writing** about ML and physics on my blog
- **Teaching** as a TA for Intro to ML and Mathematical Methods for CS
- **Following Arsenal** (when they don't break my heart)

## Quick Highlights

- **1st Place** at MIT iQuHack 2024 (Photonic Quantum GAN)
- **Research**: Presented at APS Division of Atomic, Molecular & Optical Physics (Northeast)
- **Teaching**: TA for Introduction to Machine Learning & Mathematical Methods for Computer Science
- **Fellowships**: Yale Science & Engineering Fellowship, Harvard Book Award
- **Competitive Programming**: 3x AIME Qualifier, USACO Gold Division
