## Overview

This **review paper** provides a comprehensive overview of optical metasurfaces and their applications in beam steering, holography, and computational imaging. I co-authored this work as part of my research in applied physics, exploring how nanoscale structures can manipulate light in unprecedented ways.

## What are Metasurfaces?

Metasurfaces are artificially engineered surfaces composed of subwavelength nanostructures that can control the amplitude, phase, and polarization of light. Unlike traditional optical components (lenses, mirrors), metasurfaces are ultra-thin (typically < 1 wavelength thick) and can achieve complex optical functions in a compact form factor.

## Key Applications Reviewed

### Beam Steering
- **Phased arrays**: Electronically controllable beam direction for LiDAR and free-space communication
- **Anomalous refraction**: Bending light at arbitrary angles using Huygens metasurfaces
- **Applications**: Autonomous vehicles, satellite communications, optical switching

### Holography
- **Computer-generated holograms**: Encoding 3D information in flat metasurface patterns
- **Multi-wavelength holograms**: Different images at different wavelengths
- **Applications**: AR/VR displays, 3D visualization, security features

### Computational Imaging
- **Wavefront coding**: Extending depth of field for compact cameras
- **Computational microscopy**: Super-resolution imaging beyond diffraction limit
- **Applications**: Smartphone cameras, medical imaging, microscopy

## Technical Content

The review covers:
- **Physics fundamentals**: How metasurfaces achieve phase and amplitude control
- **Fabrication methods**: Electron-beam lithography, nanoimprint lithography
- **Design techniques**: Inverse design, optimization algorithms, machine learning
- **Material platforms**: Dielectrics (silicon, titanium dioxide), plasmonic (gold, silver)
- **Performance metrics**: Efficiency, bandwidth, field of view

## Presentation

I presented findings from this review at the **APS Division of Atomic, Molecular & Optical Physics (Northeast)** conference, discussing:
- Recent advances in metasurface design using AI/ML
- Challenges in scaling metasurfaces to large areas
- Future directions: reconfigurable metasurfaces, nonlinear optics

## Impact

This review synthesized over 100 research papers and provided a roadmap for future metasurface research. It has been valuable for:
- Researchers entering the field of nanophotonics
- Engineers exploring metasurfaces for commercial applications
- Students learning about modern optics and electromagnetic theory

## What I Learned

- Deep understanding of electromagnetic theory and wave optics
- Literature review and scientific writing skills
- How to synthesize complex technical material into accessible explanations
- The importance of interdisciplinary work (optics + ML + fabrication)
